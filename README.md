# React Task

## Task Overview

This project involves creating a React application with seamless navigation using **React Router** and fetching data from various APIs to display it in 4 components. The goal is to enhance your skills in API integration, search functionality, and creative thinking.

### APIs to Integrate

You need to fetch and display data from the following APIs:

1. [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
2. [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
3. [PotterAPI](https://github.com/fedeperin/potterapi)
4. [Indian Banks Data](https://github.com/kaustubhk24/Indian-Banks-Data)

### Requirements

1. **React Router Setup:**
   - Implement **React Router** for seamless navigation between the components.
   - Create one route for each of the components (Meal, Cocktail, Potter, Indian Banks).

2. **Data Fetching and Rendering:**
   - In each component, fetch data from the assigned API and render it.
   - Ensure proper **error handling** and **loading states** while fetching data.

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - Implement search functionality in at least **two components** to filter or retrieve specific data from the API.

4. **Creativity with Indian Banks Data API:**
   - The **Indian Banks Data API** offers many possibilities. Use your creativity to build a useful application, such as:
     - Branch search by city
     - IFSC code lookup
     - Or any other innovative feature that adds value

### Additional Guidelines

- **Avoid external assistance:** Focus on solving the task independently to strengthen your learning.
- **Keep the UI intuitive and clean:** Use Google Material Design guidelines (or similar) to create a simple and appealing user interface.

### Evaluation Criteria

This task will evaluate your ability to:

- Integrate **React Router** for smooth navigation.
- Interact with APIs and display data effectively.
- Add **search functionality** to enhance the user experience.
- Apply **creative thinking**, especially for the **Indian Banks Data API**.
- Write clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

Good luck with your task!
